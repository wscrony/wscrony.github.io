I lead the [data system group](http://dslab.postech.ac.kr) at POSTECH. I am currently a team leader (단장) for [the Brain Korea 21 Program for Leading Universities & Students (BK 21) project for AI](http://ai.postech.ac.kr/sub0801) and a Full Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at POSTECH. I obtained my Ph.D degree from KAIST in 2001. My primary research efforts have been devoted to developing new techniques in DBMS "engine research." I has developed an object-relational DBMS supporting multiple language bindings. I has also developed the tight coupling technology of DBMS with IR features during my Ph.D. study. At the IBM Almaden Research Center, I has developed progressive query optimization in the parallel DB2 as a postdoc, which was adopted as adaptive query optimization by distributed DBMSs, including Spark. I also invented the new concept of "parallelizing query optimization" for faster query compilation by exploiting multi-core architecture. Our group recently developed three systems called TurboGraph++ (SIGMOD2018), iTurboGraph (SIGMOD2021) and TurboFlux (SIGMOD2018) for trillion-scale, incremental graph analytics. I regularly serve as a PC member for SIGMOD, VLDB, and ICDE. I also serve/served as an associate editor of several international journals including the VLDB Journal, IEEE TKDE, and SIGMOD Record.
